## Project Overview
This is a simple tool for Civ VI players to understand what each wonder does and what each wonder is good for based on the victory type that they are going for. There is also a section that lets the user pick their desired victory types and various civs will highlight, indicating which ones are best for the victory types selected.

## Contributing
You can help contribute trying to fix certain tasks that I would like to have done, but can't figure out myself. More coming soon!

## License
License is under me, I guess. This was for a school project, but I wanted to continue making it as a project for my portfolio.

## Contact Information
You can just message me on GitHub at NathanielTG.

## Project Status
Project is currently functional, but still in development. Am currently working on styling and making the website mobile-friendly.
